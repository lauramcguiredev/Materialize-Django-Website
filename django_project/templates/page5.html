            <p>The back-end framework we picked was Django. Overall, despite some
              difficulties, Django exceeded our expectations. Using Digital Oceanâ€™s
              one click Django Droplet made the installation process very simple.
              Creating pages with Django is not difficult, however, you do need
              to learn the "Django way" of doing things. Django uses "views" to
              access "templates" (where pages should be held) and makes developers
              choose their own custom URLs. Therefore, making pages is simple
              but there is more back end configuration that goes with it than
              with many other frameworks. Django abstracts out and streamlines a
              lot of processes. A example of this is how Django has created simple
              commands which load and commit data with a database without having
              to use SQL. In this way, yes there is a big learning curve to using Django.
              However, once you learn its way of doing things, they are usually
              faster and easier than their regular HTML/CSS/Javascript/PHP equivalent.
              Throughout this project we only just scratched the surface of the
              functionalites Django offers. There is much to learn such as how it handles
              context processors, complex queries, fixtures, etc. The Django
              website has detailed documentation to make the learning process
              easier. We are happy that we took the time to start learning about
              this powerful framework. We wish we had started learning
              and researching Django earlier as there was more of a learning curve
              than we expected. Overall, we are happy with what we accomplished would
              enjoy working with Django more in the future.

            <span class="card-title">Materialize</span>
            <p>Materialize is the front end framework we selected. After working with
              Materialize with found that it met our expectation of being easy to
              use and producing a clean and visually pleasing website. We found
              creating pages with Materialize was very straight-forward because
              of the clear documentation on their website. Materialize was also
              very easy to access and use with the CDN they provide. There wasn't
              much of a learning curve in using this framework. If you are already
              familiar with HTML, CSS, and Javascript working with Materialize comes
              quickly and easily. They have many templates you can follow and customize
              to meet your needs available on their website. Using Materialize's
              built in components and features is much easier than building comparable
              ones from scratch using HTML/CSS/Javascript/PHP. If we were to do
              this project over again it would be nice to utilize more of their
              built in features such as their carousel. We found Materialize made
              the development process simplified and produced attractive results.
              We are glad we chose to work with this framework.</p>
